# pyEIS-test-data

Experimental EIS HDF5 data files. EIS level-0 and level-1 files are also here. 

These large files rely on the Git Large File Storage (LFS) extension described here

[GIT LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/)

This is needed to properly version large files (> 100 MB). I don't think that you need to install
the extension if you just want to clone the repo.
